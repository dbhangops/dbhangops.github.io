<p>Woooo, just wrapped up another night of #DBHangOps, check out the video:<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joTOFa7Wal0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with this awesome series of videos, it's a bi-weekly meeting of MySQL DBAs via a Google Hangout to simply talk about databases (specifically MySQL).  The discussions range anywhere from silly stories to awesome learnings and even little gotchas to know about when working with MySQL operationally.  If you're interested in catching when the next #DBHangops will happen, check MySQL planet for a blog post about it, or check <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23dbhangops&#038;src=typd">this twitter search</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to talking with you!</p>
