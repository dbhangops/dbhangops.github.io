\#DBHangOps 11/13/14 -- More Orchestrator, Dealing with logical corruption, and more!
=========================================================

Hello everybody!

Join in \#DBHangOps this Thursday, **November, 13, 2014 at 11:00am pacific (18:00 GMT)**, to participate in the discussion about:

* More uses of [Orchestrator](https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator) for MySQL
* Dealing with logical corruptions (a.k.a. a bug in my application changed data it shouldn't have...)
* Mixing data and metadata

You can check out the event page at https://plus.google.com/events/cuuu7aua9sg2q7k5krlvhgqgntg on Thursday to participate.
