Heyo everybody!

Coming up this Wednesday, <strong>October 2nd, 2013 at 12:00pm pacific (19:00 GMT)</strong> is another exciting #DBHangOps.  Join the google hangout to discuss:
<ul> 
	<li>MySQL Utilities from Chuck Bell!</li>
	<li>How do you constrain over-consumption of resources by competing applications?</li>
	<li>Network vs. Local storage for MySQL<ul>
		<li>How do you use this for HA? Do you use DRBD or floating VIPs?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Secure connections to MySQL (using SSL) (requested by Daniel)<ul>
		<li>Do you have experience with this? What's the performance impact?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>PCI Certification with MySQL -- what changed for you?</li>
	<li>MySQL-isms!<ul>
		<li>(From Gerry) Sub SELECTs -- Why aren't these as mature as other databases?</li>
		<li>(From Daniel) GROUP_CONCAT and other OLAP Style query functions -- Why doesn't MySQL have them?</li>
		<li>(From Gerry) MySQL DBAs are used to building covering indexes to avoid PK lookups -- Is there a plan for this to change?</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
