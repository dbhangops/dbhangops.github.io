\#DBHangOps 10/16/13 -- Resource Management, Compliance, and more
=================================================================

**You can join \#DBHangOps at [this google hangout link](http://t.co/guQhCxY0Hb) or watch the [livestream](http://t.co/4beL1mBtTd)**

Hello everyone!

This Wednesday, **October 16th, 2013 at 12:00pm pacific (19:00 GMT)**, \#DBHangOps is coming up with discussion on:

* How do you constrain over-consumption of resources by competing applications?
* Network vs. Local storage for MySQL
    * How do you use this for HA? Do you use DRBD or floating VIPs?
* Secure connections to MySQL (using SSL) (requested by Daniel)
    * Do you have experience with this? What's the performance impact?
* PCI Certification with MySQL -- what changed for you?
* MySQL-isms!
	* (From Gerry) Sub SELECTs -- Why aren't these as mature as other databases?
	* (From Daniel) GROUP_CONCAT and other OLAP Style query functions -- Why doesn't MySQL have them?
	* (From Gerry) MySQL DBAs are used to building covering indexes to avoid PK lookups -- Is there a plan for this to change?
