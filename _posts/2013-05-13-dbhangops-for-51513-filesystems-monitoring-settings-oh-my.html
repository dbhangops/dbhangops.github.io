Heyo!

Now that we've gone through the Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo review and had an <strong>amazing</strong> turnout to talk about it, it's time to open up the discussion around things that DBAs want to talk about and need to be conscientious of.  Join us on <strong>Wednesday at 12:00pm PDT (19:00 GMT)</strong> to take part in the discussion and share your knowledge and experience with the following topics:
<ul>
	<li>Filesystems and MySQL -- Which do you use and why?<ul>
		<li>Do you handle I/O alignment? How do you do it?</li>
		<li>Scheduler changes?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Nagios checks! -- Any new checks you've added recently?</li>
	<li>The <strong>worst</strong> settings in MySQL that you always change</li>
	<li>What are the most important variables to you, and what do you set them to?</li>
	<li>What will be important variables in 5.6 that you should set?</li>
</ul>
