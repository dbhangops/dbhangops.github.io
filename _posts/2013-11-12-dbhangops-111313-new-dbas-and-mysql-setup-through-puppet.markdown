Hello everyone!

Participate in \#DBHangOps this Wednesday, **November 13th, 2013 at 12:00pm pacific (19:00 GMT)**, to hear about:

* How do you ramp up new DBAs?
	* How do you ramp up a non-DBA to being a DBA?
* How Mozilla manages MySQL through puppet
* MySQL-isms!
	* (From Gerry) Sub SELECTs -- Why aren't these as mature as other databases?
	* (From Daniel) GROUP_CONCAT and other OLAP Style query functions -- Why doesn't MySQL have them?
	* (From Gerry) MySQL DBAs are used to building covering indexes to avoid PK lookups -- Is there a plan for this to change?
