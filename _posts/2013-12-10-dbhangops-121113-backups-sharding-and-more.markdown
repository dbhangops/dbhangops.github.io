\#DBHangOps 12/11/13 -- Backups, Sharding, and more!
=========================================================

Happy Holidays!

Participate in \#DBHangOps this Wednesday, **December, 11, 2013 at 12:00pm pacific (19:00 GMT)**, to discuss:

* Backups
	* How do you do them? How often?
	* How do you test your backups?
	* What backup tools would you suggest?
* Sharding
	* How do you deal with sharded database architectures?
	* What tools do you use for managing a sharded environment?
* How do you configure your application to talk to MySQL?
	* Do you use VIPs, DNS CNAMEs, hard-coded strings in a config file, or something else?
* Load Balancers and MySQL
	* What load balancers have you use with MySQL? Why?
