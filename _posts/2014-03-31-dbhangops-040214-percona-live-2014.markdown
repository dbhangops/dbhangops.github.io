\#DBHangOps 04/02/14 -- Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo 2014!
=========================================================

Hello everybody!

For the next \#DBHangOps, we'll be meeting up for lunch at the **Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo** instead of having a virtual meeting.  If you're attending the conference, look for a \#DBHangOps table during the **Wednesday** lunch break between **12:20pm and 1:20pm pacific** to meet folks from the hangouts face to face!

Definitely keep an eye on the [\#DBHangOps twitter search](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23DBHangOps) and the [@DBHangOps](https://twitter.com/dbhangops) twitter feed for more details!

See all of you on Wednesday!
