=========================================================

Hello everybody!

Join in \#DBHangOps this Thursday, **April, 02, 2015 at 11:00am pacific (19:00 GMT)**, to participate in the discussion about:

* Getting started with `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`
	* What are issues P\_S can help you find and fix faster?
  * How does P_S start to look under load?
* What's the hardest issue you've had to debug?
  * How did it initially manifest?
  * How did you discover it?
  * How did you resolve it?
  * Any bug reports come out of it?
* Percona Live 2015 is coming up! Are you presenting? What are you excited for?
