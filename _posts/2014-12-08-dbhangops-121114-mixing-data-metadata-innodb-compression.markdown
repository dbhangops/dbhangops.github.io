\#DBHangOps 12/11/14 -- Mixing Metadata with Data, InnoDB Compression, and more!
=========================================================

Hello everybody!

Join in \#DBHangOps this Thursday, **December, 11, 2014 at 11:00am pacific (18:00 GMT)**, to participate in the discussion about:

* Mixing Metadata and Data (requested by Shlomi Noach)
  * E.g. schema representing some data instead of metadata
* InnoDB Compression (requested by John Cesario)
  * How did you performance tune it for MySQL 5.6?
  * Expected metrics changes when enabling it
  * Overall performance with InnoDB compression enabled vs. disabled
  * Comparing TokuDB and InnoDB compression

You can check out the event page at https://plus.google.com/events/cmiu31cksfj21t4b196hg7mi7jg on Thursday to participate.
