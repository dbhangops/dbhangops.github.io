\#DBHangOps 10/01/15 -- No DBHangOps this Week
=========================================================

Hello everybody!

We'll be skipping this week's DBHangOps as some people are getting settled after conferences and we're a little light on conversation this week.  Definitely check back in for **October 15th, 2015** where we'll talk about upcoming talks at the MySQL Central conference, review favorite talks from Percona Live Amsterdam, and more!

As always, you can still watch the [\#DBHangOps twitter search](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23DBHangOps), the [@DBHangOps](https://twitter.com/dbhangops) twitter feed, or this blog post to get more details about the next DBHangOps!
