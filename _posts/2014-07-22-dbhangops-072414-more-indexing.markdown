\#DBHangOps 07/24/14 -- More Indexing!
=========================================================

Hello everybody!

Join in \#DBHangOps this Thursday, **July, 24, 2014 at 11:00am pacific (18:00 GMT)**, where we pick up on our [last conversation about indexing](http://dbhangops.github.io/2014/07/08/dbhangops-071014-mysql-index-types/):

* Indexing
	* More discussion on geo spatial indexes
	* Fulltext indexing and ranking
	* MariaDB indexing features (From Gerry!)
	* Anything else indexing!

Be sure to check out the [\#DBHangOps twitter search](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23DBHangOps), the [@DBHangOps](https://twitter.com/dbhangops) twitter feed, or this blog post to get a link for the google hangout on Thursday!

See all of you on Thursday!
