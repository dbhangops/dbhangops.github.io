===========
## Semi-Sync replication
* See Morgan's blog post about semi-sync replicationa at http://www.tocker.ca/2014/06/05/semi-sync-replication-is-not-slow.html
* You can follow a step-by-step tutorial at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-semisync-installation.html for setting it up!
* To ensure that semi-sync replication stays enabled, you'll want to persist the following changes into your my.cnf on the master:
		[mysqld]
		rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled=1
		rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout=1000 # 1 second

	and on the slave:
		[mysqld]
		rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled=1

## MySQL 5.7 PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
* PSHelper has been forked into SYS to provide more than just performance_schema helpers
	* Check out SYS at https://github.com/MarkLeith/mysql-sys/
* SYS provides new views:
	* X$ views are the same as ps_helper views, just with raw data
* SYS is also now packaged with MySQL Workbench.  There's some good integrations here:
	* http://mysqlworkbench.org/2014/03/mysql-workbench-6-1-performance-schema-reports/
* New instruments in 5.7 PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
	* Lots of instruments around transactions: events_transactions_*
		* events_transactions_current will give you the state of currently executing transactions on the server
			* The NESTING_* fields are used to run hierarchical queries
		* events_transactions_history_long will show the last 10000 transactions run on the server
	* Memory instruments: memory_summary_*
		* In MySQL 5.7.4 the memory instruments don't capture information from the InnoDB storage engine. There's work being done on this for a future release
	* Metadata locks!
		* You can track metadata locks at any level on the server (global, table, etc.)
		* Identify the owners and sessions of the locks
* Can PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA be extended to add instruments for other storage engines?
	* You can potentially patch your own instruments in
	* Feel free to file bugs on the MySQL bug tracker for instruments you'd like to see!
