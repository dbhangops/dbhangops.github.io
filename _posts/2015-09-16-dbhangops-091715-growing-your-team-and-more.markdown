## Growing your team
### What's your hiring criteria?
* For seasoned DBAs
  * Really want someone who understands production systems and has operational sensibilities
  * Systems and operations focus
  * Support engineering teams in developing new automation
  * Developing your own automation and setting up configuration management
  * Someone who has (or can develop) distributed systems expertise and managing systes of scale
  * Hold perspective on a high-level architecture
* Having the "standard stuff"
  * Make sure backups are good and working
  * managing and reviewing schemas

### Onboarding for success
* Want your new DBAs to get experienced with the application stack quickly
* it's important to hold a good relationship with the engineers that write client applications for the database infrastructure
* Want your whole stack to be more reliable and remove inefficiencies
* Identifying areas for automation with a fresh perspective
* New hire checklist!
  * Put together a living document that all new hires should follow to get acquainted with your environment
* Potentially find a junior member of the organization that you can grow into the role

### What advice would you give to a new DBA
* Read!
  * there's been a lot of exciting blogs written up in the past few months about scaling mysql and caveats to be aware of
  * Read the MySQL documentation, but also be up to date
* Avoid confining yourself to a single topic/discipline
  * If you don't know about something, dig into it and go deeper
* Learn the common toolkits and their uses (e.g. percona toolkit, MySQL utilities, common_schema)
* If it's broken fix it. Don't accept things where they are.
* Find out where the backups are. Test them if they're not tested.
* Write documentation about the whole environment from your perspective and grow it
* Reach out to other people outside your team.
  * Don't be shy to talk to the sys admins, network operations team, sales team, etc!
  * Make friends outside your team!

## New Hot Tech?
* Containers
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
